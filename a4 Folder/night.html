  <p>The best bars in Brickell has not always been an easy list to put together. Only recently has Miamis financial district begun to attract things other than calculator-strewn office buildings. Now, Brickell is a bona fide neighborhood and one of the fastest growing ones in Miami. Not only can you find one of the best malls in Miami in Brickell, but youll also find some of the best restaurants in Miami too. Of course, people dont want to just eat and leave. They want to stay and have a drink. And then maybe another. And, hey, how about one more? Luckily, Brickell has been steadily building its boozy portfolio over the last handful of years and today its bar scene is absolutely nothing to sneeze at. Theres something here for just about every budget, taste and tolerance for elevation.</p>
